# Aim to solve 
1. Medical Imaging(computer vision)
Disease Detection: Classify tumors in X-rays, MRIs, CT scans.

Segmentation: Identify organs/tumors (e.g., U-Net for brain tumor segmentation).

COVID-19 Detection: Analyze lung CT scans for infections.


2. Electronic Health Records (EHR) Analysis
Predictive Modeling: Forecast patient outcomes (e.g., ICU mortality).
Time-Series Forecasting: Predict disease progression (e.g., diabetes).
